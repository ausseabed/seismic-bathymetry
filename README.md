# seismic-bathymetry

The scripts contained in this repository were developed by Ulysse Lebrec from University of Western Australia, funded by National Seabed Mapping - Geoscience Australia, in a joint collaboration to derive a workflow and produce bathymetry surfaces from data collected from offshore seismic surveys.

The scripts are considered experimental and not recommended for production purposes.
